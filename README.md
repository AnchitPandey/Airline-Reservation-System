# Airline Reservation System

In this project, I created a miniature version of a flight reservation software using WPF and WCF. The WPF app would interact with the WCF services to request/send data. The WCF services would process the data and interact with SQL Server database to fetch data. This is a multi-threaded application, allowing and handling concurrent reservations of a particular seat by two different customers.
